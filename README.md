# Amalgamautas App 
## Virtual Store for Fan Boys and Collectors

A new web store application. 
This project is a starting point for an application that will be held as a retailer company experiment.

## Getting Started

First is goog to understand some geneal and fundamental concepts. Flutter is a Google open source and reactive framework that uses **Dart**, an object oriented language designed to be make the programming experience easy to learn and even easier if you already know Java, C# or JavaScript. 

Cross-platform, accesible native features, SDK (Software Development Kit), widgets (one word that you will hear a lot when using this framework) and fast reloads on devices and emulators. Everything you need for developing beautiful applications. it's bundled with UI rendering components, device API access, navigation, tons of libraries, stateful management, testing. No doubt is a rich set of components. For last and not least Flutter has for Material Design and Cupertino too, that allow developers to easily render the UI on both iOS and Android platforms. 

Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or use [DardPad](https://dartpad.dev/?null_safety=true) to practice code in Dart without downlading anything.
